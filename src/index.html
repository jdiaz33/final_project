   <p class="text-justify"><strong>Origins of Microsoft</strong> is a website based on the
   film "Triumph of THE NERDS" which was released in June, 1996. Starring Robert X.
   Cringely who is a technology journalist and have written magazine articles about the
   pioneers of the computer industry. In the film  he tells the story of how personal
   computers were born and he interviews a bunch of guys that he call nerds but that in
   today's world they have made history, they are multimillionaires and own this huge
   industry.</p>

   <p class="text-justify">At the time when personal computers were created, several of
   these founders of the PC revolution started their own companies such as Apple Computer
   and Microsoft. The film explains the general concept of the creation of personal
   computers speaking of the different founders of these companies, but this website will
   focus only on the achivements of Microsoft and their founders. How they started and
   what was their individual role in the invention.</p>

   <p class="text-justify">Normally when people hear the name Microsoft, they immediately
   relate it to only one person, the famous Bill Gates. But according to the film, there
   are another two gentelmen that also played a huge role on the invention of the first
   computer and the creation of Microsoft. We are talking about Paul Allen and Steve
   Ballmer who along with Bill gates founded what todays is worth over $226 billion.</p>
