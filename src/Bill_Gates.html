       <p><strong>William Henry "Bill" Gates</strong> was born on October 28, 1955. He is
       an American business magnate, philanthropist, investor, computer programmer, and
       inventor. Gates is the former chief executive and chairman of Microsoft, the
       world's largest personal computer software company, wich he co-founded with Paul
       Allen.</p>

       <p>At age 13 Gates took an interest in programming the General Electric system used
       at school in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He
       wrote his first computer program on this machine. While in hingschool he met his
       buddy Paul Allen</p>

       <p>In 1973, Gates enroll at Harvard College where he met Steve Ballmer, who would
       later succeed Gates as CEO of Microsoft. In his sophomore year, Gates devised an
       algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems
       presented in a combinatorics class. Gate's solution held the record as the fastes
       version for over thirty years.</p>

       <p>Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard and spent a
       lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen.
       </p>

       <p>The following year Gates saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the
       Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen waw this as the opportunity to star their own
       computer software company.</p>
      
       <p><em>"Paul showed that to me and then okay, here was a company that would be
       needing software"</em></p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6">
       <img src="img/mag.gif" class="R">

       <p>After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demostrated the
       Altair 8800, Gates contacted MITS to inform them that he and others were working on
       a BASIC interpreter for the platform. MITS president agreed to meet them for a
       demo, and the demostration was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to
       distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC.</p>

       <p><em>"We realised that things were starting to happen, and just because we'd had
       a vision for a long time of where this chip could go, what it could mean, that
       didn't mean the industry was going to wait for us while I stayed and finished my
       degree at Harvard"</em></p>

       <p>After the demo succeeded, Bill forgot about finishing university. Afraid of
       missing his chance to dominate the new idustry, he joined Allen in what was then
       the center of the world microcomputing research -- among the sleezy bars and gas
       stations of Albuquerque, New Mexico. They would work all night long, and there were
       days when Bill Gates would be sleeping on the floor in the software lab.<br>
       On November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of
       the Secretary of the state of New Mexico. Microsoft became independent of MITS in
       late 1976, and it continued to develop programing language software for various
       systems.</p>
