       <p><strong>Paul Gardner Allen</strong> was born on January 21, 1953. An american
       philanthropist, investor and innovator, best known as the co-founder of Microsoft
       Corporation alongside Bill Gates.<br>Almost thirty years ago, young men like Paul
       Allen and Bill Gates invented the personal computer and in doing so launched a
       revolution that's changed the way we live, work and communicate.</p>
          
       <p><em>"One day in Boston, I was in Harvard Square I saw a cover of Popular
       Electronics with this thing that looked like what I had been imagining, and so I
       grabbed it off the shelf, I looked at it and I bought it and I ran back to Bill's
       dorm"</em></p>

       <p>Allen went to Washington State University, but dropped out after two years in
       order to work as programmer for Honeywell in Boston, placing him near his old
       friend again. Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in
       order to create Microsoft.</p>

       <p>Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1975,
       and began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter. Allen came up with
       the original name of "Micro-Soft". In 1980, after promising to deliver IBM a Disk
       Operating System they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC, Allen
       spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operatin System
       written by Tim Paterson.</p>
       
       <p>As a result of this transaction, Microsoft was able to secure a contract to
       supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM's PC line. This contract with IBM
       was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen and Gates' wealth.</p>
